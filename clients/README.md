## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skido600/todotask.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    ```bash
    cd todotask/clients
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server and watch for file changes, run the following command. This will compile the Tailwind CSS file (`input.css`) into the final stylesheet (`output.css`).

```bash
npm run dev
```

After running the command, you can open the main `index.html` file (likely located in the `public` directory) in your web browser to view the application. Any changes made to `public/src/input.css` or your HTML files using Tailwind classes will trigger an automatic rebuild of the stylesheet.
